# View Past Referrals

To view **past referrals**, simply login into the referral form. On the left side, you will be able to see a list of people you have referred and their current status.

### How to trace user journey

Let's take an example. You refer Mr. David. He is interested in the project and makes a site visit. After Mr. David completes the site visit, the icon under **Site Visit** will change it's color to **green**.

Similarly, when Mr. David books the project, the icon under **Booked** will change it's color to **blue**.

When Mr. David makes the payment for the project, the icon under **Paid** will change it's color to **green**. After this you will be eligible for your referral reward.

If Mr. David is not interested in the project, the icon under **lost** will change it's color to **red** and the referral will no longer be eligible to earn you rewards.
